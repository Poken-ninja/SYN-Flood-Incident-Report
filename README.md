# SYN Flood Incident Report – Cybersecurity Analysis

This repository contains a structured incident report analyzing a SYN Flood attack. It demonstrates hands-on application of cybersecurity principles, log analysis, and response strategy for denial-of-service threats.

## What is a SYN Flood Attack?

A SYN Flood is a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that exploits the TCP handshake process. The attacker sends numerous SYN packets but intentionally avoids completing the handshake, leaving server connections half-open and consuming system resources.

---

## TCP 3-Way Handshake (Recap)

1. SYN – Client initiates connection  
2. SYN-ACK – Server acknowledges  
3. ACK – Client completes handshake  

In a SYN Flood attack, the third step (ACK) is never sent by the attacker. This results in hundreds or thousands of half-open connections.

---

## Indicators of SYN Flood in Logs

- Repeated SYN packets from the same source IP address  
- No ACKs following the SYN-ACK responses  
- High number of half-open connections  
- Increase in RST (reset) packets or connection timeouts  
- Server unable to accept legitimate traffic

## Summary of the Incident

- **Attacker IP Address:** 203.0.113.0  
- **Target Web Server:** 192.0.2.1  
- **Impact:** Server resources exhausted, web service became unavailable  
- **Root Cause:** Incomplete TCP handshakes due to crafted SYN packets

## Incident Response Actions

### Immediate

- Notify internal security and IT response teams  
- Temporarily block attacker IP via firewall  
- Restart impacted services to clear connection backlog

### Long-Term

- Configure SYN flood protection via rate-limiting or SYN cookies  
- Implement DDoS mitigation services  
- Regularly analyze server logs  
- Conduct red team/blue team exercises to improve readiness
